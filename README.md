How It Works
The Mortgage Calculator utilizes a standard formula known as the "mortgage payment formula" to calculate the monthly mortgage payment. The formula is derived from the principles of compound interest and amortization.

Calculation Formula:
The formula for calculating the monthly mortgage payment (M) is as follows:

M = P * (r * (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)
